# Network Penetration Testing with Real-World Exploits and Security Remediation

## Project Description
This project demonstrates real-world penetration testing techniques using Kali Linux as the attacking machine and Metasploitable 2 as the vulnerable target. It includes:
- Network scanning
- Enumeration
- Exploitation of known services
- User privilege escalation
- Password cracking
- Security remediation

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Kali Linux** (Attacker OS)
- **Metasploitable 2** (Target OS)
- **Nmap** – Network and port scanning
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation
- **John the Ripper** – Password cracking
- **Linux Commands** – User management and system enumeration

## Tasks Covered
1. Basic Network Scan
2. Port and Service Enumeration
3. Operating System Detection
4. Enumeration of Open and Hidden Services
5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Services (FTP, SSH, Java RMI)
6. Creating a Root User
7. Cracking Password Hashes
8. Remediation for Detected Vulnerabilities

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with ethical hacking tools.
- Understanding how attackers scan, identify, and exploit system vulnerabilities.
- Gained knowledge on security best practices and how to defend against common attacks.
- Learned the importance of regular updates, service hardening, and strong password policies.

## How to Use
1. Open the Word document **Network_Penetration_Testing_Project.docx**.
2. Follow the tasks step by step in your own lab setup.
3. Replace IP addresses and usernames with your own values where applicable.
